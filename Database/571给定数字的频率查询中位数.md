# 571 给定数字的频率查询中位数

## 题目

Numbers 表保存数字的值及其频率。

    +----------+-------------+
    |  Number  |  Frequency  |
    +----------+-------------|
    |  0       |  7          |
    |  1       |  1          |
    |  2       |  3          |
    |  3       |  1          |
    +----------+-------------+
在此表中，数字为 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3，所以中位数是 (0 + 0) / 2 = 0。

    +--------+
    | median |
    +--------|
    | 0.0000 |
    +--------+
请编写一个查询来查找所有数字的中位数并将结果命名为 median

## 思路

1. 分析本题，在给定了数字及对应数量的基础上，让查询出中位数；
2. 首先我们知道如果要求中位数，首先要确定中位数所处的下标，然后输出这个下标对应的数字，我们可以将寻找下标的过程进行拆解，第一步，我们先找到每一个数字的起始和结束下标，形成每一个数字的下标范围，第二步确定所有数字的中位数下标范围，第三步寻找两者的交集，即为所求中位数；
3. 在求两者交集的过程中要考虑两个下标区间的范围的包含问题

## 结论

1. 通过自连接，根据计算所有大于每个数字的数字的frequency的和，就是当前数字的起始下标，并作为临时表A；

    ```sql
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `beg`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER > N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.NUMBER
    ) AS A
    ```

2. 同起始下标类似，我们只要计算出所有大于等于每个数字的frequency的和，就是当前数字的结束下标，并作为临时表B；

    ```sql
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `end`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER >= N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.number
    ) AS B
    ```

3. 根据NUMBER连接临时表A和临时表B,就可以求出每个数字的起始和结束下标;

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `beg`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER > N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.NUMBER
    ) AS A
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `end`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER >= N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.number
    ) AS B
        ON (A.NUMBER = B.NUMBER)
    ```

4. 根据sum(frequency)求出所有数字的中位数下标范围，作为临时表C(数字总数N是偶数时，下标(N-1)/2和N/2位置处为中位数。N是奇数时，下标(N-1)/2为中位数。
数字的频率之和为N。确定中位数区间[beg,beg+cnt+1)，beg从0开始。因此我们只需要通过两个值，一个记录(N-1)/2，另一个根据是否是偶数记录0和1，然后它们的和[beg,beg+cnt+1)就是中位数所处的区间)；

    ```sql
    (
        SELECT FLOOR((SUM(N.frequency)-1)/2) AS `beg`,
            if(SUM(N.frequency)%2=1,0,1) AS `cnt`
        FROM numbers AS N
    ) AS C
    ```

5. 目前已经得到了每个数字的区间S=[A.beg,B.end)，和中位数的区间T=[beg,beg+cnt+1)，这里求两者的交集时会遇到下面两种情况：
    1. T区间长度 >= S区间长度
        + 判断区间S与区间T是否相交，逻辑为：
            if(S的起点落在区间T中 或 S的尾部落在区间T中)
            {
                满足此条件的数据行为中位数行
            }

            ```sql
            (
                (C.beg <= A.beg AND A.beg < (C.beg +C.cnt+1)) 
                OR 
                (C.beg < B.END AND B.END <= (C.beg +C.cnt+1))
            )
            ```

    2. T区间长度 < S区间长度
        + 判断区间S与区间T是否相交，逻辑为：
            if(T的起点落在区间S中 或 T的尾部落在区间S中)
            {
                满足此条件的数据行为中位数行
            }

            ```sql
            (
                (A.beg <= C.beg AND C.beg < B.end) 
                OR 
                (A.beg < (C.beg+C.cnt+1) AND (C.beg+C.cnt+1) <= B.END)
            )
            ```

    + 求交集合在一起

        ```sql
        (
            (
                (C.beg <= A.beg AND A.beg < (C.beg +C.cnt+1)) 
                OR 
                (C.beg < B.END AND B.END <= (C.beg +C.cnt+1))
            )
            OR
            (
                (A.beg <= C.beg AND C.beg < B.end) 
                OR 
                (A.beg < (C.beg+C.cnt+1) AND (C.beg+C.cnt+1) <= B.END)
            )
        )
        ```

6. 将A,B,C三个临时表合在一起，并加入求交集逻辑，然后求出中位数的平均数并重命名结果为AVG(A.NUMBER) AS `median`

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(A.NUMBER) AS `median`
    FROM
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `beg`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER > N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.NUMBER
    ) AS A
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT N1.NUMBER, SUM(IF(N2.frequency IS NULL,0,N2.frequency)) AS `end`
        FROM numbers AS N1
        LEFT JOIN numbers AS N2 ON (N1.NUMBER >= N2.NUMBER)
        GROUP BY N1.number
        ORDER BY N1.number
    ) AS B
        ON (A.NUMBER = B.NUMBER)
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT FLOOR((SUM(N.frequency)-1)/2) AS `beg`, if(SUM(N.frequency)%2=1,0,1) AS `cnt`
        FROM numbers AS N
    ) AS C
        ON (
                (
                    (C.beg <= A.beg AND A.beg < (C.beg +C.cnt+1))
                    OR 
                    (C.beg < B.END AND B.END <= (C.beg +C.cnt+1))
                )
                OR
                (
                    (A.beg <= C.beg AND C.beg < B.end)
                    OR
                    (A.beg < (C.beg+C.cnt+1) AND (C.beg+C.cnt+1) <= B.END)
                )
            )
    ```

7.除此之外，我们还可以使用用户自定义变量的方法进行求解，逻辑上是一致的，表达方式上更加简洁，这里不在详述
